Hi and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafael and I am interested in understanding the **physiological mechanisms mammals developed to survive in extreme environmental conditions**.

Currently, I am working withÂ **[Elena Gracheva and Slav Bagriantsev](https://campuspress.yale.edu/squirrel/?ref=rafael-home)**Â to elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms hibernating ground squirrels use to allow their sexual maturation process to occur during their very first hibernation season.

I am from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and throughout my journey, several mentors guided me and supported my ideas. **Without their support, nothing would have been possible.** Therefore, I am to inspire and impact other Brazilians students through organizations such asÂ **[Iniciativa Proxima](https://www.iniciativa-proxima.org/?ref=rafael-home)**Â - which aims to train and empower the next generation of Brazilian scientists.
