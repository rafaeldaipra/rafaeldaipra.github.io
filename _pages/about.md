Rafael is interested in understanding the physiological mechanisms mammals use to survive in extreme environmental conditions.

Currently, he is working with **[Elena Gracheva and Slav Bagriantsev](https://campuspress.yale.edu/squirrel/?ref=rafael-home)** to elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms hibernating ground squirrels use to allow their sexual maturation process to occur during their very first hibernation season.

Rafael is originally from Brazil and throughout his journey, several mentors guided him and supported his ideas. Without their support, nothing would have been possible. Therefore, Rafael aims to inspire and impact other Brazilians students through organizations such as **[Iniciativa Proxima](https://www.iniciativa-proxima.org/?ref=rafael-home)** - which aims to traing and empower the next generation of Brazilian scientists.
