Hi and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafael and I am interested in understanding the **physiological mechanisms mammals developed to survive in extreme environmental conditions**.

Currently, I am working withÂ **[Elena Gracheva and Slav Bagriantsev](https://campuspress.yale.edu/squirrel/?ref=rafael-home)**Â to elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms hibernating juvenile ground squirrels use to allow their sexual maturation process to initiate during their very first hibernation season, when they have no access to food, nor water during continuous exposure to very cold temperatures.

Beyond my dedication to science, I am also deeply committed to outreach initiatives. Coming from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·, I have been fortunate to receive invaluable guidance and support from numerous Brazilian mentors throughout my journey. These wonderful individuals made my achievements possible, and now, I aspire to make a positive impact on the next generation of Brazilian scientists through **[Iniciativa Proxima](https://www.iniciativa-proxima.org/?ref=rafael-home)**. This program serves as an umbrella initiative, aiming to train and empower Brazilian students and foster their growth.

Furthermore, I have been actively involved in teaching and inspiring students from the New Haven area through Pathways to Science at Yale. My work involves developing engaging activities related to sensory physiology, allowing students to explore the wonders of science and physiology.

Outside of the lab, I really enjoy dancing! Especially tango, attending classes, practices, milongas and events with the **<a href="https://www.yaletangoclub.com/"> Yale Tango Club. </a>** :dancer:
