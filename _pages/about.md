Hi and welcome! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rafael and I am interested in understanding the **physiological mechanisms mammals developed to survive in extreme environmental conditions**.

Currently, I am working withÂ **[Elena Gracheva and Slav Bagriantsev](https://campuspress.yale.edu/squirrel/?ref=rafael-home)**Â to elucidate the neurophysiological mechanisms hibernating ground squirrels use to allow their sexual maturation process to occur during their very first hibernation season, when they have no access to food, nor water during continuous exposure to very cold temperatures.

In addition to science, I am also committed to outreach initiatives. I am from Brazil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡· and throughout my journey, several mentors guided me and supported my ideas. **Without their support, nothing would have been possible.** As a way to give back, I aim to inspire and impact the next generation of Brazilian scientists throughÂ **[Iniciativa Proxima](https://www.iniciativa-proxima.org/?ref=rafael-home)**Â - an umbrella program that aims to train and empower brazilian students. In addition to that, I have been teaching and inspiring students from New Haven area as well via Pathways to Science at Yale -- teaching and developing activities related to sensory physiology.
